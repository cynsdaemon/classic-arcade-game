--------

This repo serves as a home for the 'Classic Arcade Game' project in the Udacity [Frontend Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) Nanodegree.

This project is an exploration in using object-oriented programming concepts to store and organize information, analyze functions at runtime, and using prototypal inheritance and methods.

You may view the live project [here](https://cynsdaemon.github.io/classic-arcade-game/). Note: You will need to use a modern web browser and have JavaScript enabled.

How to play
--------
This game is inspired by the [classic Konami 1981 arcade game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), Frogger. The player must overcome various platform obstacles to help Frogger safely reach its home at the end of the path.

Colliding with an enemy bug, knocks Frogger back to the beginning of the path, but reaching Frogger's watery home at the end of the path wins the level. :sunglasses:

**To move Frogger:** Use your keyboard's directional arrows (up :arrow_up:, right :arrow_right:, down :arrow_down:, left :arrow_left:) to maneuver around the platform.
